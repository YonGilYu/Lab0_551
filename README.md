ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

For each webpage I created a navigational bar on top of the webpage to get from any page on my website to any other page, header with my name below navigational bar and copyright line on the bottom.

1. index.html - main page contains short bio paragraph about myself.

2. contact.html - contact page contains my contact information which are ucalgary email, gmail, my phone number and address. It also has a map form yandex maps that shows the exact location of my address.

3. gallery.html - gallery page contains a carousel photos of myself with location of where the photo was taken at and short comments for each.

4. interests.html - interests page contains a table with my top-5 interests that I have with short reasoning for each.

5. style.css - in style.css stylesheet, I put background wallpapaper, changed font for every h1 header, indicated height for each image, indicated margins for each container class, and aligned everything in class footer (copyright) to center.

6. style0.scss - in style0.scss stylesheet, I used some scss nesting and inheritance. I added 2 colors (color (darkmagenta) and color1(darkblue)) variables, align variable which is equal to center and font variable which is equal to Arial font. For each h1 header I changed its color to darkmagenta and aligned it to center. For each paragraph I changed its color to darkblue and font to Arial. For navigational bar items, I changed it font to Calibri, made it bold, changed font size to 24px and made grey background for each item.

7. style0.css - is compiled from style0.scss file so that web browser could understand it.
